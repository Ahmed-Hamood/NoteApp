<p class="text">
 Getting started with react is fairly simple. After it's installed using <console>create-react-app [folder_name]</console> on the command line. It will create your react
 application project with all necessary functionality you need, already build into the app.
</p>

<p class="text">
 First thing we are going to do is clean up your files project and keep some of them, then we are going to start writing code with react. Now go a head and open your
 project folder in your text editor like <blue>"VSCODE"</blue>. The first thing you want to look at is the file structure. <red>Create-React-App </red> has already
 installed several files for you, and organized several of them into folders. of them into folders. Your main folders are a <blue>src</blue> folder and a
 <blue>public</blue> folder. (Don't run your react app yet [Error Run] still we are not done)
</p>

<p class="underline-text"># The project folder files and directories :-</p>

<p class="text">
 Your main folders are a src folder and a public folder. Let's clean our react project from un-necessary files something like <green3>"png/svg"</green3>,
 <green3>"json"</green3>, <green3>"txt"</green3>, <green3>"md"</green3>, <green3>"css"</green3> and delete all javascript files except
 <green3>"./src/App.js"</green3> (One Component), <green3>"./src/index.js"</green3> (start up file), and keep <green3>"./public/index.html"</green3> file it has the
 <blue>&lt;div id="root"> &lt;/div></blue>
 where all of the content will be output. You don’t need to change that, but just know that it’s there.

<p class="sub-title get-title">2 - Understand <code>package.json</code> Scripts</p>

<p class="text">
 If you go to the <red>package.json</red> file, you can see that the <blue>create-react-app</blue> has installed several react scripts for you. We have four main scripts
 <red>"start"</red>, <red>"build"</red>, <red>"test"</red> and <red>"eject"</red>. We are going to view each script individually, in your project root directory you'll
 see a <blue>package.json</blue> file content which has all your react scripts as following.
</p>

<p class="underline-text"># the content of <red>package.json</red> file, where you find your four main scripts :-</p>

<div class="terminal-block terminal-code code">
 <pre><code class="js language-jsx">
{

    "start": "react-scripts start",

    "test": "react-scripts test",  
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"  
  }
  ....
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p class="text">Now that we know what a script is and where to find them, let’s dive into each one and explain what it does to a React app.</p>

<p class="red bold font-code fz-32 mgb-30">- <code>start</code></p>

<p class="text">
 The <red>"start"</red> script enables you to start the server on <blue>"development"</blue> NODE_ENV mode. When you run the following command react will open the app on
 <path>http://localhost:3000</path> to view it in the browser.
</p>

<p class="underline-text"># the start script enables you to start the server on development mode, using the following command line :-</p>

<div class="terminal-block terminal-code code">
 <pre><code class="js language-jsx">
> npm start
</code></pre>
</div>

<p class="text">
 The command above will not only start the server, but it will also update live and display the latest change occurs every time you edit your react code. In addition, it
 will show lint errors on the terminal (console) when it fails to start the server in the form of meaningful error messages.
</p>

<p class="red bold font-code fz-32 mgb-30">- <code>build</code></p>

<p class="text">
 After creating several files or components within separate folders. These separate files need to be merged or bundled to be precise in one single file. The
 <red>"build"</red> command script will build your react project on <blue>"production"</blue> NODE_ENV mode, it ensure that the finished project is bundled, minified and
 optimized. You must know that the <blue>"development "</blue> mode is not optimized. React create a new folder called <blue>"build"</blue> where all your final project
 files bundled, optimized and ready for production.
</p>

<p class="underline-text"># the build script enables you to build your application on production mode :-</p>

<div class="terminal-block terminal-code code">
 <pre><code class="js language-jsx">
> npm build
</code></pre>
</div>

<p class="text">
 The command above will Builds the app for production to the <blue>"build"</blue> folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the
 best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
</p>

<p class="red bold font-code fz-32 mgb-30">- <code>test</code></p>

<p class="text">
 The <red>create-react-app</red> uses <green3>Jest</green3> as a test runner. The <red>"test"</red> script enables you to launch the test runner in interactive watch
 mode. We will dive deep into <blue>testing react app</blue> later. But keep in mind that any file with <green3>.test.js</green3> or <green3>.spec.js</green3> extensions
 will be executed when the script is launched.
</p>

<p class="underline-text"># the test script can be run on the terminal with the following commands :-</p>

<div class="terminal-block terminal-code code">
 <pre><code class="js language-jsx">
> npm test
</code></pre>
</div>

<p class="red bold font-code fz-32 mgb-30">- <code>eject</code></p>

<p class="text">
 The <red>create-react-app</red> comes with an excellent configuration that helps you build your react app with the best practices in mind to optimize it. When you run
 <red>"eject"</red> script it will remove the single build dependency from your project if you are not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices that
 <red>create-react-app</red> provides for you. That means it will copy the configuration files and the transitive dependencies <blue>(Webpack, Babel, ESLint etc.)</blue>
 as dependencies in the package.json file. If you do that, you’ll have to ensure that the dependencies are installed before building your project.
</p>

<p class="underline-text"># the eject script can be run on the terminal with the following commands :-</p>

<div class="terminal-block terminal-code code">
 <pre><code class="js language-jsx">
> npm eject
</code></pre>
</div>

<p class="text">
 After running the command above, it won't be possible to run it again since all scripts will be available except the <red>eject</red> one. Use this command only if you
 need to. Otherwise, stick with the default configuration. It’s better, anyway.

<p class="sub-title get-title">4 - Understanding <blue>Functional Components</blue> vs. <blue>Class Components</blue> in React</p>

<p class="text">
 <red>Components</red> let you develop the UI of the website independently and even we can use reusable components to implement a similar UI. In React there is two ways
 of writing a react component. One uses a function and the other uses a class. Recently functional components are becoming more and more popular. We will help you
 understand the difference between functional and class components.
</p>

<p class="sub-sub-title mark get-title">A - Rendering JSX</p>

<p class="text">
 The difference here is the syntax, a <red>Functional Component</red> is just a plain Javascript function or an arrow function that returns <green>JSX</green>. A
 <red>Class Component</red> is a JavaScript class that extends React.Component which has a render method.
</p>

<p class="underline-text"># Define a functional component that returns JSX :-</p>

<div class="js-block js-code react-code code">
 <p class="block-title">➤ ./src/App.js</p>
 <pre><code class="js language-jsx">
  import React from "react";

  // Plain Javascript Function 
  function FunctionalComponent() {
    return &lt;h1> Hello, world &lt;/h1>;
   }

  // Arrow Function ES6 
  const FunctionalComponent = () => {
   return &lt;h1> Hello, world &lt;/h1>;
  };
</code></pre>
</div>

<p class="text">
 In other hand defining a <red>Class Component</red>, you have to make a class that <red>extends</red> <blue>React.Component</blue>. The JSX to render will be returned
 inside the <code>render()</code> method.
</p>

<p class="underline-text"># Define a class component that returns JSX, with using Destructuring :-</p>

<div class="js-block js-code react-code code">
 <p class="block-title">➤ ./src/App.js</p>
 <pre><code class="js language-jsx">
  import React, { Component } from "react";

  // Using Destructuring to extract Component class from react
  class ClassComponent extends Component {
   render() {
     return &lt;h1> Hello, world &lt;/h1>;
   }
  }
</code></pre>
</div>

<p class="underline-text"># Define a class component that returns JSX, without using Destructuring :-</p>

   }
  }
</code></pre>
</div>

<p class="sub-sub-title mark get-title">B - Passing props</p>

<p class="text">
 let’s see how they are written in both class and functional components. Inside a <red>Functional Component</red>, we are passing props as an argument of the function.But
 in <red>Class Component</red> you need to use <blue>"this"</blue> to refer to props. Let’s say we are passing props of the name <green3>"Adam"</green3> like below.

   }
  }

</div>

<p class="sub-sub-title mark get-title">C - Handling state in Functional Component And Class component</p>

<p class="text">
 To use state variables in a <red>Functional Component</red>, we need to use <blue>useState</blue> Hook, which takes an argument of initial state. in the following
 example a useState hook takes an argument of initial state. We start with 0 clicks so the initial state of count will be 0.
</p>

<p class="underline-text"># Handling state by using state hooks in functional components :-</p>

<div class="js-block js-code react-code code">
 <p class="block-title">➤ ./src/App.js</p>
 <pre><code class="js language-jsx">
  const FunctionalComponent = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
   
    return (
      &lt;div>
        &lt;p>count: {count}&lt;/p>
        &lt;button onClick={ () => setCount(count + 1)}>Click&lt;/button>
      &lt;/div>
    );
   };
</code></pre>
</div>

<p class="text">
 The initial state can be <green>null</green>, <green>string</green> and even <green>object</green>. The useState hook return the current state using the
 <red>count</red> variable, and a function <red>setCount()</red> that updates it, we are destructuring the array two elements of the array consider them as a state and
 its setter.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Handling state in a <red>Class Component</red> is a bit different, we define a constructor first. Inside the constructor you will make a state object with a state key
 and initial value. And inside JSX, we use <blue>this.state.count</blue> to access the value of the state key we defined in the constructor to display the count. Setter
 is pretty much the same, just different syntax.

        count: 0
      };
    }
   
    render() {
      return (
        &lt;div>
          &lt;p>count: {this.state.count} times&lt;/p>
          &lt;button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
          &lt;button onClick={() => this.setState((state) => { return { count: state.count + 1 } } })}>
            Click
          &lt;/button>

<p class="sub-sub-title mark get-title">D - Lifecycle Methods</p>

<p class="text">
 Lifecycles play an important role in the timing of rendering. For those of you who are migrating from class components to functional components, you must be wondering
 what could replace lifecycle methods such as <red>componentDidMount()</red> in a <red>Class Component</red>
 And yes, there is a hook that works perfectly for the purpose, let’s check it out!
</p>

<p class="red bold font-code fz-28 mgb-30">- componentDidMount() and useEffect(() => { }, []) Hook</p>

<p class="text">
 The lifecycle method <red>componentDidMount()</red> is called right after the first render completes. There used to be a componentWillMount that happens before the first
 render, but it is considered legacy and not recommended to use in newer versions of React.
</p>

<p class="underline-text"># Invoke <red>componentDidMount</red> using the useEffect hook :-</p>

<div class="js-block js-code react-code code">

    }, []);
    return &lt;h1> Hello, World &lt;/h1>;
  };
</code></pre>
</div>

<p class="text">
 Replacing <red>componentDidMount()</red>, We use the useEffect hook with the second argument of <green>[]</green>. The second argument of the useState hook is normally
 an array of a state(s) that changes, and <blue>useEffect</blue> will be only called on these selected changes. But when it’s an empty array like this example, it will be
 called once on mounting. This is a perfect replacement for a <red>componentDidMount()</red>.

<p class="text">
 Now using <red>componentWillUnmount()</red> syntax is a bit different in a <red>Functional Component</red>, we can use a <blue>useState</blue> hook for unmounting. But
 be careful, the syntax is a bit different. What you need to do is return a function that runs on unmounting inside the <blue>useEffect</blue> function. This is usefull
 especially when you have to clean up the subscriptions such as a clearInterval function, otherwise it can cause a severe memory leak on a bigger project. One advantage
 of using useEffect is that we can write functions for both mounting and unmounting in the same place.

<p class="sub-title get-title">5 - When to use the Class Component and the Functional Component ?</p>

<p class="text">
 To answer this question we need to have a decent understanding of the state of the component. In <red>Class Component</red>, the render method will be called, whenever
 the state of the components changes. On the other hand, the <red>Functional components</red> render the UI based on the props.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Whenever we have the use case with the State of the component and rendering the UI based on the Component State, use the <red>Class Component</red>. It should be
 preferred whenever we have the requirement with the state of the component.
</p>

<p class="text">
 In <blue>React 16.8</blue> we can use state in <red>Functional Components</red> also, so there is no need to use the class components. In version 16.8 Hooks were
 introduced and with the use of useState hook we can use the state in <red>Functional Components</red> also. It is advised that you use
 <red>Functional Components</red> rather than <red>Class Components</red> by Facebook itself.
</p>
