<!-- ##################################################################################### -->
<p class="sub-title get-title">1 - What is React ?</p>

<p class="text">
 <red>React</red> (sometimes called React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library for building fast, interactive, efficient and flexible user interfaces. It's an open
 source component base front-end JavaScript library responsible only for the view layer of the application. It's maintained by Facebook and a community of individual
 developers and companies. It is widely used as a base in building single-page websites and mobile applications. It is very easy to use, and it allows users to create
 reusable UI components.
</p>

<p class="text">
 <red>React</red> designs a simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right component when your data changes.
 Think of component as a simple function that you can call with some input and they render some output. And as you can reuse functions, so also you can reuse components,
 merge them and thereby creating a complex user interface.
</p>

<p class="underline-text"># Here is an example of cutting a page into components, each section highlighted above is considered a component:</p>

<img path="/img/image001.PNG" id="image" alt="" />

<p class="text">
 We can say that <red>React</red> is a way to build user interfaces, it's only concerned with what you see on the front-end. React makes user interfaces very easy to
 build by cutting each page into pieces. We call these pieces components (learn later).
</p>

<p class="text">
 <red>React</red> is a lightweight view library that only supports the UI components. Therefore, it requires integration with other technologies and tools (such as Flux
 and Redux) in order to get a full-fledged architecture.
</p>

<p class="sub-title get-title">2 - Features of React, and it's Advantages</p>

<p class="text">
 There are unique features are available on <red>React</red> like <blue>JSX</blue>, <blue>Virtual DOM</blue>, <blue>Component</blue>, <blue>Performance</blue> and
 <blue>One-way Data Binding</blue>. Because of These features that's why <red>React</red> is widely used and popular. Let's take a look at these features.
</p>

<p class="text">
 <red>Use JSX (Javascript XML)</red>, it's an extension of JavaScript it's faster than normal javascript as it performs optimizations while translating to regular
 JavaScript. It makes it easier for us to create templates. Though it is not mandatory to use JSX in react, it is one of the good features and easy to use.
</p>

<p class="text">
 <red>Virtual DOM</red> exists because it's a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. a virtual DOM is the representation of an original DOM. React creates a virtual dom
 in-memory data-structure cache. Only the final changes of DOM has later updated in the browsers DOM. Manipulating DOM is slow, but manipulating Virtual DOM is fast as
 nothing gets drawn on the screen.
</p>

<p class="text">
 <red>One-way Data Binding</red> This feature gives you better control over your application. React uses a unidirectional data flow. Meaning, the developers cannot edit
 any component directly. They have to utilize the callback function in order to make changes in the components. This process is called one-way data binding.
</p>

<p class="text">
 <red>Components</red> are like pure JavaScript functions that help make the code easy by splitting the logic into reusable independent code. A Component is one of the
 core building blocks of React. It'll make the task of building UIs much easier. You can see a UI broken down into multiple individual pieces called components and work
 on them independently and merge them all in a parent component which will be your final UI.
</p>

<p class="text">
 <red>Performance</red> React.js use JSX, which is faster compared to normal JavaScript and HTML. Virtual DOM is a less time taking procedure to update webpages content.
 all these features makes react perform fast and efficient.
</p>

<p class="underline-text"># Advantages of React :-</p>

<div class="list-content">
 <ul>
  <li>
   <red>React</red> uses virtual dom that makes use of in-memory data-structure cache, and only the final changes are updated in browsers dom. This makes the app faster.
  </li>
  <li>You can create components of your choice by using the react component feature. The components can be reused and also helpful in code maintenance.</li>
  <li><red>React</red> is an open-source javascript library, so it is easy to start with.</li>
  <li>
   <red>React</red> has become very popular in a short span and maintained by Facebook and Instagram. It is used by many famous companies like Apple, Netflix, etc.
  </li>
  <li>Facebook maintains ReactJS, the library, so it is well maintained and kept updated.</li>
  <li><red>React</red> can be used to develop rich UI for both desktop and mobile apps.</li>
  <li>Easy to debug and test as most of the coding is done in Javascript rather than on Html.</li>
 </ul>

<p class="sub-title get-title">3 - Using ReactJS from CDN</p>

<p class="text">
 To start working with react, we need to first install reactjs. You can easily get started to use reactjs by using the CDN javascript files, as shown below. Go to the
 official site of reactjs to get the CDN links, <a id="only-link" target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html">Click here</a>
</p>

<p class="underline-text"># The following CDN versions are meant only for development, and are not suitable for production:-</p>

<p class="text">
 To load a specific version of <red>react</red> and <red>react-dom</red>, replace 17 with the version number. if you are planning to use the CDN files, make sure to keep
 the cross-origin attribute, to avoid cross-domain issues. <red>Reactjs</red> code cannot be executed directly in the browser and needs to be transpired using
 <blue>Babel</blue> to javascript before executing in the browser.
</p>

<p class="text">

 browsers.

<p class="sub-title get-title">5 - Install React Using <code>npx create-react-app [project_name]</code></p>

<p class="text">
 You can create a <blue>React</blue> application by installing the <code>create-react-app</code> tool-chain command. Facebook has created Create React App environment
 that will create a live development server and automatically compile React and all other things. You can install each react package like in our previous example, or use

<p class="text">
 To create a new React project, we can use the tool npx, provided you have an npm version of at least 5.2. npx gives us the ability to use the create-react-app package
 without having to first install it on our computer, which is very convenient. Using npx also ensures that we are using latest version of Create React App to create our
 project:
</p>

<p class="text-box note">You can check what npm version you have by running in your terminal <span class="blue bold font-code">"npm -v"</span> command.</p>

<p class="text">
 Once we run this command, a folder named "my-react-app" will be created where we specified on our computer and all of the packages it requires will be automatically
 installed. The <code>create-react-app</code> will set up everything you need to run a React application. And make sure you should not use uppercase letters for your
 application name.
</p>

<p class="text-box note">
 If you’ve previously installed create-react-app globally via <span class="blue bold font-code">"npm install -g create-react-app"</span>, we recommend you to uninstall
 the package using <span class="blue bold font-code">"npm uninstall -g create-react-app"</span> to ensure that npx always uses the latest version
</p>

<p class="text">
 Create React App doesn’t handle backend logic or databases; it just creates a frontend build pipeline, so you can use it with any backend you want. Under the hood, it
 uses Babel and webpack, but you don’t need to know anything about them.
