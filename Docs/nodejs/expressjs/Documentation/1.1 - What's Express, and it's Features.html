<p class="sub-title get-title">- What is Express ?</p>

<p class="text">
 <span class="red bold">Express</span> is a web Framework based on the core <span class="blue bold">Node.js HTTP</span> module And
 <span class="blue bold">libraries connect components</span> called plugins or <span class="orange bold">middleware</span>.
</p>

<p class="text">
 <span class="red bold">Express</span> is based on the <span class="blue bold">Node.js</span> middleware module called <span class="blue bold">connect</span> components,
 which in turn uses <span class="blue bold">http</span> module. So, any middleware which is based on connect will also work with Express.js.

<p class="text">
 <span class="red bold">Express</span> provides a minimal interface with all the tools required to build a web application. It adds flexibility to an application with a
 huge range of modules available on npm that you can directly plug into Express as per requirement.
</p>

<p class="text">
 <span class="red bold">Express</span> lets you structure a web application to handle multiple different http requests at a specific URL. It helps you respond to requests
 with route support so that you may write responses to specific URLs

<p class="sub-title get-title">- Express Features</p>

<p class="text">
 <span class="red bold">Express</span> solves these and many other problems. It provides ways to reuse code elegantly and provides a model-view-controller (MVC)-like
 structure for your web apps. In node one large request handler function for all requests, but in express each request has its own function
