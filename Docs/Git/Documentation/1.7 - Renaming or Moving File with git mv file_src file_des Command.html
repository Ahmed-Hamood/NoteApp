 1.7 - Renaming or Moving File with <terminal><orange>git mv file_src file_des</orange></terminal> Command
</p>

<p class="text">
 In Git renaming or moving files is a two-step operation, first we have to modify our working directory and then we have to stage two type of changes an addition and a
 deletion Git provides a special command that does both operation in one step, the <terminal>git mv file_src file_des</terminal> command. Lets check both operations first
 before we learn about our special command.
</p>

<p class="text">
 We have a single file in our working directory, and that is <file>file1.txt</file> we are going to rename it to <file>main.js</file> by using the
 <terminal>mv</terminal> command in unix to rename <file>file1.txt</file>. First let's view our project folder content.
</p>

<section terminal-content title-value="List Directory Content" preferred-sign=">" line-num="">
 <pre>
  ls
</pre

</section>

<div class="terminal-output">
 <pre>
  file1.txt
</pre
 >
</div>

<p class="text">With <terminal>mv</terminal> command we can <sky>Rename</sky> or <sky>Remove</sky> files and directories.</p>

<section terminal-content title-value="Rename File name" preferred-sign=">" line-num="">
 <pre>
  mv file1.txt main.js
</pre
 >
</section>

<p class="text">
 Let's run <terminal>git status</terminal> and see our changes, will see that we have two changes both are un-stages because they are indicated by red. We a have
 <file>file1.txt</file> with delete operation, and under untracked files we have a new file called <file>main.js</file> as we know Git doesn't automatically track all
 your new files
</p>

<section terminal-content title-value="Check Working Directory status" preferred-sign=">" line-num="">
 <pre>
  git status
</pre
 >
</section>

<div class="terminal-output">
 <pre>
  On branch master
  Changes not staged for commit:
    (use "git add/rm &lt;file>..." to update what will be committed)
    (use "git restore &lt;file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
          <red>deleted:    file1.txt</red>
  
  Untracked files:
    (use "git add &lt;file>..." to include in what will be committed)
          <red>main.js</red>
  
  no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
</pre>
</div>

<p class="text">
 Every time you have a new file in your project you have to add it to the staging area, so <red>Git</red> starts tracking it. So we need to use the
 <terminal>git add</terminal> command, to stage both these changes.
</p>

<section terminal-content title-value="Commit staging and Get Status" preferred-sign=">" line-num="">
 <pre>
  git add file1.txt // Stage file1.txt deletion
  git add main.js // Stage main.js addition
  git status

<div class="terminal-output">
 <pre>
  On branch master
  Changes to be committed:
    (use "git restore --staged &lt;file>..." to unstage)
          <green>renamed:    file1.txt -> main.js</green>
</pre>
</div>

<p class="text">
 Now, Git recognized that ewe renamed <file>file1.txt</file> to <file>main.js</file>, as you see renaming is indicated by green which means this is in the staging area,
 and ready to commit it to the repository.
</p>

<section terminal-content title-value="Commit our Changes to the Repository" preferred-sign=">" line-num="">

  git commit -m "file Rename from file1.txt to main.js"

  1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
  rename file1.txt => main.js (100%)
</pre
 >
</div>

<p class="text">
 Let's do renaming again, but with our special <terminal>git mv</terminal> command to rename or move our file in one step, instead of using the standard Linus/Unix
 <terminal>mv</terminal> command, We are going to use the <terminal>git mv file_src file_des</terminal> command.
</p>

<section terminal-content title-value="Rename main.js to file1.txt & Get Status" preferred-sign=">" line-num="">

<p class="text">
 We renamed <file>main.js</file> file into <file>file1.txt</file> without the need to commit multiple changes. Our <terminal>git mv</terminal> command the changes are
 applied to both the working directory amd the <yellow>staging area</yellow>. Now let's commit the changes.

 <pre>
  [master 3dc0bb3] Refactor code
  1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
  rename main.js => file1.txt (100%)
</pre
 >
</div>

<p class="text">
 If you look at the statistics, one file has changed and we have zero insertions because we haven't added any new lines to any of our files, and also have a zero
 deletions because we haven't remove any lines from any files
