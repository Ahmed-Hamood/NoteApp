<p class="text">
 Now our project directory is using <text red>Git</text>, inside our project we have Git Repository which is a hidden sub-directory in our project directory. In daily
 basis tasks we add or modify files in our project directory, sometime our project state we want to record/save these changes or we can say commit those changes into our
 repository
</p>

<img id="image" alt="" path="/img/image001.PNG" alt="" />

<p class="text">
 Creating a commit its like taking a snapshot of our project or saving the current project state. There is a special area that comes between before and after committing
 our project files, this special intermediate area called <yellow>"Staging Area"</yellow> or <yellow>"Index"</yellow>, this stage comes before commit.
</p>

<img id="image" alt="" path="/img/image002.PNG" alt="" />

<p class="text">
 The <text green>Staging Area</text> is place where we store our snapshot before we commit them. When we make changes like adding or modifying file, we add these files to
 the staging area, here we review our changes if everything is good then we make a commit or snapshot record that will get our files permanently stored in our repository.
</p>

<img id="image" alt="" path="/img/image003.PNG" alt="" />

<p class="text">
 As we say the staging area allows us to review our work before recording a snapshot, if some changes shouldn't be recorded as part of the next snapshot then we can
 easily
 <text orange>un-stage</text> them and commit them as a part of another snapshot as deleted/removed simple as that.
</p>

<img id="image" alt="" path="/img/image004.PNG" alt="" />

<p class="text">Each commit has a unique identifier that gets generated by <text red>Git</text> like revision number. every commit contain information like.</p>

<div class="list-content normal check">
 <ul>
  <li>ID</li>
  <li>Message</li>
  <li>Date/time</li>
  <li>Author</li>
  <li>Completed snapshot at the time it was created</li>
 </ul>
</div>

<p class="text">
 How Git stores data, Git internal functionality or implementation Compress our content and doesn't store duplicate content. Each commit contain a complete snapshot of
 our project, and this allow us to quickly get back to a previous state
</p>

<p class="sub-title">- Real Example</p>

<p class="text">
 Here's an example, let's say er have a couple of files <file>file1</file> and <file>file2</file>, and they are ready to be in committed/recorded state, before that we
 have to add them to staging area state before committing them, to add those file into the staging area we use the following command.
</p>

<section terminal-content title-value="Add Files into the Staging Area" preferred-sign=">" line-num="">
 <pre>
  git add file1 file2
</pre
 >
</section>

<img id="image" alt="" path="/img/image005.PNG" alt="" />

<p class="text">
 Now our files in the <text green>staging area</text>, we review these files everything is good, so we decider to commit these files by using the commit command to
 permanently store as a snapshot into the repository we use the following command
</p>

<section terminal-content title-value="Take Snapshot to the Repository" preferred-sign=">" line-num="">
 <pre>
  git commit -m "initial commit"
</pre
 >
</section>

<img id="image" alt="" path="/img/image006.PNG" alt="" />

<p class="text">
 We supply a meaningful message to indicate what the snapshot represents, this only is useful to have a useful history. Each <text green>commit</text> or
 <text yellow>snapshot</text> that you save has a message that explains the state of the project at that point in time
</p>

<img id="image" alt="" path="/img/image007.PNG" alt="" />

<p class="text">
 When you commit our snapshot, a copy of our files remain in the staging area. Let's say we fixed a bug so we make some changes to file1, as we know currently we have an
 old version of file in the <text>staging area</text> because we haven't staged the changes yet
</p>

<img id="image" alt="" path="/img/image008.PNG" alt="" />

<p class="text">
 Once again we use the add command to stage the changes, now we have the updated file1 in the staging area which is the same file in the working directory.
</p>

<img id="image" alt="" path="/img/image009.PNG" alt="" />

<p class="text">
 So, lets make a commit to record this state, now we have two commits in our repository, the second commit message it's describes the bug that we just fixed.
</p>

<img id="image" alt="" path="/img/image010.PNG" alt="" />

<p class="text">
 Now, we realize that we no longer need <file>file2</file> because it contains unused code, so we delete it from our working directory, but still <file>file2</file> in
 the staging area.
</p>

<img id="image" alt="" path="/img/image011.PNG" alt="" />

<p class="text">
 So, again we should use the <terminal>add file2</terminal> command to stage this change in this case the deletion occur, although Git know that file2 is deleted, so it
 will deleted also from the staging area ready for next commit snapshot. Now we can <text green>commit</text> our changes.
</p>
