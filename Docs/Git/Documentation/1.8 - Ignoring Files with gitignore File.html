<p class="main-title">1.8 - Ignoring Files with <Text red>.gitignore</Text> File</p>

<p class="text">
 On every project we may have a certain files and directories that we want <text red>Git</text> to ignore, we don't to include files that are generated as a result of
 compiling or while installing addition packages, this is going to increase the size of our repository, and developers may have valuable files that they don't want to
 share and synchronize with other team members.
</p>

<p class="text">
 We are going create a few files and directories and learn how to configure Git to ignore these files. Lets create a directory called <folder>/Log</folder> and within it
 we create a file called <file>info.log</file>, Open your <red bold underline>GitBash</red> Terminal and type the following Commands.
</p>

<section terminal-content title-value="Create Directory and File" preferred-sign=">" line-num="">
 <pre>
  mkdir logs // Create a new directory called 'logs'
  echo "log info 001" > logs/info.log // Create info.log file inside our logs directory
  git status // check Git Status
</pre
 >
</section>

<div class="terminal-output">
 <pre>
  On branch master
  Untracked files:
    (use "git add &lt;file>..." to include in what will be committed)
          <red>logs/</red>
  
  nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track) 
</pre
 >
</div>

<p class="text">
 When you run <terminal>git status</terminal> command, you gonna see that git have un-tracked directory called <folder>/log</folder>, we don't want to add this folder to
 the <yellow bold cap>staging area</yellow>, because we don't <red bold underline>Git</red> to track <folder>/log</folder> folder.
</p>

<p class="text">
 To prevent Git from tracking files and directories, we have to create a special file inside the root of your project called <file>.gitignore</file>, this file has no
 name it only has an extension. So, lets create this file open your <red>GitBash</red> Terminal again and type the following Commands
</p>

<section terminal-content title-value="Create .gitignore file and add a new line" preferred-sign=">" line-num="">
 <pre>
  echo logs/ > .gitignore // create .gitignore file and add a new line
  code .gitignore // open .gitignore in vscode
</pre
 >
</section>

<div class="terminal-output">
 <pre>
  logs/
</pre
 >
</div>

<p class="text">
 In <file>.gitignore</file>, we have a single entry <folder>logs/</folder> which indicates a directory with all it's content that we want to ignore. We can have a list of
 files and directories or even ignore sub-directory only. Also we can use patterns to ignore files with certain extension.
</p>

<div class="terminal-output">
 <pre>
  logs/           <yellow>--> ignore log directory content</yellow>
  node_modules/   <yellow>--> ignore node_modules directory content</yellow>
  users/private/  <yellow>--> ignore users/private directory, only private content</yellow>
  main.log        <yellow>--> ignore main.log file</yellow>
  process.env     <yellow>--> ignore process.env file</yellow>
  *.txt           <yellow>--> pattern ignore all files with .txt extension </yellow>
  *.log           <yellow>--> pattern ignore all files with .log extension </yellow>
  note/*.txt      <yellow>--> pattern ignore all files with .txt extension inside the note directory </yellow>
  note/p1/*.txt   <yellow>--> pattern ignore all files with .txt extension inside the note/p1/ sub-directory only </yellow>
</pre>
</div>

<p class="text">After we done, we can save the changes and go back and open the <terminal>terminal</terminal> back again</p>

<section terminal-content title-value="Check Git Status" preferred-sign=">" line-num="">
 <pre>
  git status
</pre
 >
</section>

<div class="terminal-output">
 <pre>
  On branch master
  Untracked files:
    (use "git add &lt;file>..." to include in what will be committed)
          <red>.gitignore</red>

  nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
</pre
 >
</div>

<p class="text">
 As you see Git ignored all our files and directories because it's ignoring it instead it says we have a new file called <file>.gitignore</file>. Lets add this file to
 the <yellow underline cap bold>staging area</yellow> and then commit our code with a proper message.
</p>

<section terminal-content title-value="Commit and add .gitignore file to the repository" preferred-sign=">" line-num="">
 <pre>
  git add .gitignore // add .gitignore to the staging area
  git commit -m "add gitignore file" // commit changes to the repository
</pre
 >
</section>

<div class="terminal-output">
 <pre>
  [master 8965726] add gitignore file
  1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
  create mode 100644 .gitignore
</pre
 >
</div>

<p class="text-box note">
 Remember, this only works if you haven't already included a file or a directory in your repository, if you include a file in your repository and then later added it to
 <file>.gitignore</file> Git is not going to ignore that, the file will stay in the <yellow underline cap bold>staging area</yellow>
</p>

<p class="text">
 For example If you accidentally include a file in your repository and then later you decided to add it to <file>.gitignore</file>, actually Git is not going to ignore
 that file because its already been added to the staging area. So, next we will learn how remove files from the <yellow bold underline cap>staging area</yellow> that have
 been added by accident.
