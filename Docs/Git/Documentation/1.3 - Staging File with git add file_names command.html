<p class="text">
 We will learn about staging a file with <red>Git</red>, the purpose of the <yellow>staging area</yellow> is review our changes before Committing/snapshot them into our
 repository. Lets start by adding a couple of file to our project that uses Git as the version control System. We are going to create a file called
 <file>file1.txt</file>. To create a new file, open your GitBash Terminal and type the following code.

<p class="text">
 Now we have two files in our project, both files are not tracked by <red>Git</red> so we need to initialize a <red>Git Repository</red> in our project directory. Next
 let's initialize Git in our project.

<!-- ################################################################################################################ -->
<p class="sub-title">2. Initialize Git in our Project <terminal>git add</terminal></p>

<p class="text">
 To enable Git in our project directory with its content, we will use the <command>git init</command> command in order to initialize Git inside our project directory.

<p class="sub-title">3. Check the status of our Project using <command>git status</command> command</p>

<p class="text">
 We are gonna run the <terminal>git status</terminal> command that will show us the status of the working directory in the <yellow>Staging Area</yellow>. This command
 check if our project files are tracked in the staging area or not.

<p class="text">
 As you see above, both <file>file1</file> and <file>file2</file> are untracked files, because they are not in the <yellow>Staging Area</yellow> yet. To add these file to
 the <yellow>Staging Area</yellow> we need use the add command which we will learn below.
</p>

<!-- ################################################################################################################ -->
<p class="sub-title">4. Staging File with the <command>git add</command> command</p>

<p class="text">
 To add both <file>file1</file> and <file>file2</file> into the staging area, we will use the <terminal>git add Your_Files</terminal> command, we have a different ways to
 add files we can specify a single file, or specify multiple files separated by a space, also we can use patterns like <terminal>*.txt</terminal> to add all the files
 with <blue>.txt</blue> extension.
</p>

<section terminal-content title-value="Check Project Files status" preferred-sign=">" line-num="">
 <pre>
  git add file1.txt // add a single file into the staging area
  git add file1.txt file2.txt // add a multiple file into the staging area
  git add *.txt  // add all files with .txt extension
  git add .  // add the entire directory recursively (including sub-directories)
  git add *  // add the entire directory recursively (including sub-directories)
</pre
 >
</section>

<p class="text">
 Be carful while using the <terminal>git add .</terminal> because sometimes there are file that you don't want to add to your repository perhaps large file like full
 library, which will increase the size of our repository. We will learn later about how to ignore certain files and prevent git committing them.

 Now both <green>file1</green> and <green>file2</green> are in the staging area that are ready yo be committed, to confirm that we run
 <terminal>git status</terminal> command. We will see that we have two new file and they are indicated by green which means they are in the staging area.

<p class="text">
 What will happen if you Modify <yellow>file1.txt</yellow> file from the working directory, the file will become untracked which mean need to be staged again because
 <yellow>file1.txt</yellow> from the staging area is old, and need to be updated or tracked to the latest change. Let's modify file1.txt and see what will happen.
</p>

<section terminal-content title-value="Modify file1.txt" preferred-sign=">" line-num="">

 Now let's run <terminal>git status</terminal> command, and look we have two files in the staging area because they are indicated by green. And we also have one modified

<p class="text">
 In the staging area we have the first version of <yellow>file1.txt</yellow>, we changed <yellow>file1.txt</yellow> after we added it to the <red>staging area</red>, this

<img id="image" alt="" path="/img/image017.PNG" alt="" />

<p class="text">
 Let's add file1.txt newer version into the staging area, so we run <terminal>git add file1.txt</terminal> tp add file1.txt to the staging area. Then we run
 <terminal>git status</terminal> command to show the status of our working directory.

<p class="text">
 As you see the working directory status has both files in the staging area with <file>file1.txt</file> latest file update, and we don't have any un-staged changes which
 mean both files latest changes/updates are ready to be committed for snapshot to permanently store it in our git repository.

<p class="text">
 We decided to delete <file>file2.txt</file> file from our working directory because we don't need it anymore. We know that both files are in staging area separated from
 the files in working directory So lets remove file2.txt file and see what will happen.
