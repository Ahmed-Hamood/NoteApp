<p class="main-title">1.10 - Short Status with <terminal orange>git status -s</terminal> command</p>

<p class="text">
 We have learned how to get the status of the working directory and the <yellow bold cap>staging area</yellow> using the <terminal>git status</terminal> command. This
 command output is very comprehensive or thorough. As you see below we will create and modify some files then we are going to run <terminal>git status</terminal> command.

<section terminal-content title-value="Create/Modify files & get Git status" preferred-sign=">" line-num="">
 <pre>
  echo "new text" > file2.txt // create new file called file2.txt
  echo "add new text" >> file1.txt  // modify file called file1.txt
  git status

<div class="terminal-output">
 <pre>
  On branch master
  Changes not staged for commit:
    (use "git add &lt;file>..." to update what will be committed)
    (use "git restore &lt;file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
          <red>modified:   file1.txt</red>

  Untracked files:
    (use "git add &lt;file>..." to include in what will be committed)
          <red>file2.txt</red>

  no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
</pre>
</div>

<p class="text">
 As you can see we have a modified <file>file1.txt</file>, and also we have a new <file>file2.txt</file> file un-tracked. The output of our
 <terminal>git status</terminal> command is very comprehensive and very wordy.
</p>

<p class="text">
 We have an alternative way we can supply the <terminal>git status -s</terminal>, the short <terminal>-s</terminal> dash flag. With this command we will get two column.

<div class="list-content normal check">
 <ul>
  <li>

   available in the working directory

  <li><yellow underline bold>Right Column</yellow>: represents the working directory</li>

 When we stage a file <red bold underline>git</red> takes a snapshot of that file and puts it in the <yellow bold cap>staging area</yellow>, so if you modify that file

 Lets add <file>file1.txt</file> to the staging area one more time, and then run <terminal>git status -s</terminal> command, you will see that all the changes that we had

 As you see <terminal>git status</terminal> show that <file>file2.txt</file> is been added to the <yellow bold cap>staging area</yellow> for the first time. This is how
 the <terminal>git status -s</terminal> command output is simple and brief.
