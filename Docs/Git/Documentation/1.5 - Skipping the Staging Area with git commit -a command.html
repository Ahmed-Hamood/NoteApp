 1.5 - Skipping the Staging Area with <terminal><orange>git commit -am ""</orange></terminal> Command
</p>

<p class="text">
 We don't always need to stage our changes before <red>committing</red> them into <green>repository</green>, you must know what you are doing, if your changes don't need
 to be reviewed then do it. As we know the <yellow>staging area</yellow> is place where you want to review your changes before committing them to repository.
</p>

<p class="text">
 To skip the <yellow>staging area</yellow>, first let's modify both files <file>file1.txt</file> and <file>file2.txt</file> and then commit them in one step without
 passing them to the stating area. From the command line we are going to append new line in both files.
</p>

<section terminal-content title-value="Modify Files and Get the Working Directory Status" preferred-sign=">" line-num="">
 <pre>
  echo "Hello, Mr Adam" >> file1.txt  // modify 'file1.txt'  
  echo "New Information" >> file2.txt   // modify 'file1.txt'  
  git status // get working directory status
</pre
 >
</section>

<div class="terminal-output">
 <pre>
  On branch master
  Changes not staged for commit:
    (use "git add &lt;ile>..." to update what will be committed)
    (use "git restore &lt;ile>..." to discard changes in working directory)
          <red>modified:   file1.txt</red>
          <red>modified:   file2.txt</red>
  
  no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
</pre>

<p class="text">
 Now our working directory have multiple files that been modified or changes and need to be staged for commit. Instead of running <terminal>git add .</terminal> command
 to commit our changes in two steps, we are going to use the <terminal>git commit -m</terminal> command and supply the option <code>-m</code>, which means commit all
 modified file into repository.
</p>

<section terminal-content title-value="Commit all modified file in one step" preferred-sign=">" line-num="">
 <pre>
  git commit -a -m "Fix the bug that prevent users from login" // provide the -a option and -m option
  git commit -am "Fix the bug that prevent users from login"  // combine these two option together
</pre

</section>

<div class="terminal-output">
 <pre>
  [master 8225f98] fixed bug that prevent users
  2 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
</pre

</div>

<p class="text">
 As you see we commit our files without staging them or we skipped the <yellow>staging area</yellow> step. Once again do this only if you know what you are doing, but
 most of the times you are going to stage you code before committing it to the staging area
