  In Android development, you write views in Kotlin or Java; in iOS development, <a id="ref-link" href="ref_002"></a> you use Swift or Objective-C. With React Native, you can invoke these views with JavaScript using React components. At runtime, React Native creates the corresponding Android and iOS views for those components. Because React Native components are backed by the same views as Android and iOS, React Native apps look, feel, and perform like any other apps. We call these platform-backed components Native Components.

  The patterns and tools provided by Redux make it easier to understand when, where, why, and how the state in your application is being updated, and how your application
  logic will behave when those changes occur </b
 >. Redux guides you towards writing code that is predictable and testable, which helps give you confidence that your application will work as expected.
